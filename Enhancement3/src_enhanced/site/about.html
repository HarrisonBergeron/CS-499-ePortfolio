            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <div class="about-info">
                <p>Welcome to Shepard Real Estate&trade;! Are you looking for a new home? Here you will find thousands of house listings in SoCal that are actually <em>affordable</em>.</p>
                <h2>Development Process</h2>
                <p>At Shepard Real Estate&trade;, we take pride in supplying the most up-to-date information for our customers. We want it to be a breeze for customers like you to enter your location information into the search bar and instantly be shown a list of homes in the area. That's why we've designed this website the way we did; simply click the "Find Listings" button on the navigation bar or complete a quick search from the home page to get instant results! We designed this website for your ease of use. Our simple global navigation site structure allows you to navigate from the home page to any other site page just from the navigation bar. To get in touch with us, apply for a job, or download our mobile app, view the mini-links at the bottom of our home page.</p>
                <p>Creating our website from scratch was a journey. After designing the initial website skeleton and navigation scheme, we took to fleshing out each page individually. One goal we had was to create a table for our website, including information about our various trusted real estate agents. To do this, we used a &lt;table&gt; element with &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, and &lt;td&gt; elements to layout the rows and cells of our real estate agent directory table.</p>
                <p>We also wanted to include a &lt;form&gt; element on our site, so we nested various &lt;form&gt; elements like &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;textarea&gt; to create a "Contact Us" user interface. A &lt;button&gt; with a type of "submit" was used to allow you, our user, to send your contact information and personal message to us.</p>
                <p>Lastly, we wanted to include some multimedia in the form of a YouTube video on our website to show you the kind of homes you can expect to find here. Check out the embedded video at the bottom of this page!</p>
                <p>The design choices we made when incorporating these elements into the HTML of our website were implemented using CSS. Keep reading to see why we made the choices we did.</p>
                <h2>Defense of Our Final Product</h2>
                <p>We hope you are enjoying your experience on our website. You may have noticed the deep red burgundy color we used across the site. We opted for a single color scheme and white backgrounds for aesthetic value and to keep the layout visually pleasing to the eye. Our goal was to keep the colors of the site interesting but not overly distracting.</p>
                <p>Do you like the font we used throughout the website? It's called "Ubuntu" and is available on <a href="https://fonts.google.com" class="footer-link">fonts.google.com</a>. It is our hope that this makes your viewing experience more pleasurable, as we thought this font was more readable than common serif fonts.</p>
                <p>One common theme throughout our site is the use of resizable, centered window panes that will adjust based on the size of the viewport. The goal of this design was to improve the website experience on varying screen sizes.</p>
                <p>We used a grid layout to manage the navigation bar at the top of our website to keep things organized for you. The various actions you can perform are listed on the left, and your account information is on the right.</p>
                <p>Our home page is laid out in a way that combines aesthetics with ease-of-use. A large search bar centered in a visually pleasing banner facilitates the process of customers jumping into finding house listings without having to click any buttons on the navigation bar. Additional site information is displayed at the bottom of the home page to provide access to additional resources.</p>
                <p>Our "Find Listings" page shows a list of all the houses that match your search query. To prevent these items from overflowing on the page, we added a scroll bar to allow you to see every listing using your mousewheel.</p>
                <p>Our "Find an Agent" page shows a table with neatly arranged information about our featured real estate agents to make it easy for users to look up contact and location information.</p>
                <h2>Opportunities for Improvement and Growth</h2>
                <p>We acknowledge that nothing is perfect, including our new website. Please use our "Contact Us" form from the link on our home page to give us feedback if you have any tips for us! We realize there is always room for improvement.</p>
                <p>Firstly, we'd love to include some new pages in the future. We want our users to be able to "favorite" listings to save them to their account, as well as be able to see a more detailed view of individual listings.</p>
                <p>With the use of JavaScript, we hope to improve our search engine to make it more dynamic, in addition to including "filters" that allow users to state their price range or limit listings based on required amenities.</p>
                <p>A real estate agent database that allows users to see the history and reviews of various agents would be another desirable feature of our site.</p>
                <p>Animations that play when buttons are clicked are a stylistic feature that we may want to include given more time.</p>
                <p>We also realize there may be some accessibility issues for people who use screen readers. In the future, we would like to better organize HTML elements to make it easier for screen readers to render quick descriptions of our pages.</p>
